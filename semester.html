		<h2>about  programing</h2>
		<p>
			We learned the basics of web dsining </br> it means that we know some HTML and CSS </br> these langages are necesery to build the site from the side of the user. 
		</p>
		<p>
			these languages are mostly good for making up the understandig of how to talk to the computer and get us thinking more like programers.</br> for example, tables are esy for humas, we just draw the borders and write whatever we want in it. </br> but not computers, every part of the table have a diffrent Tag (Tag is like a word in HTML)</br> so it is a lot more comlicted.
